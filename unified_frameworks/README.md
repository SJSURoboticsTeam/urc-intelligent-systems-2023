# Unified Frameworks

The objective of Unified Frameworks is to try and combine work done by individuals into a coherent mechanism. For example Eliot and Rahul have been working separately on setting up the camera and lidar for autonomy. In the larger picture these two lidar and camera will have to merge together as one sensor array which creates the rovers world view. I'm hoping we can use Unified Frameworks as a means to unify our individual works into a cohesive system.
