"""
Approach to running the Lidar set up.
I'm thinking of running a separate thread for each and every task being run for the Lidar navigation.
Here are the tasks that will each get its own thread.
    1. Lidar Data Consumption:
        The Lidar produces a lot of sensor data. This data needs to be consumed quickly 
        or else it will build up inside the Lidar's internal buffer. This build up creates
        a lag in the delivery of Lidar data. To prevent this there will be a dedicated thread
        to consume data from the Lidar and make it available to other threads.
    2. Visualization:
        I'm a visual person and visualization helps to understand whats going on in code. So I'm
        making this thread to visualize all code activity. This thread will visualize what the 
        Lidar sees, it will visualize the navigation planning and anything else that will be helpful
        to visualize. Important! - This should not be where processing should happen. When visualization 
        is not needed it should be possible to just stop this thread and everything else should run normally
    3.  Data maintenance:
        A separate thread is to process Lidar data into point cloud with persistance and to convert that
        into obstacles
