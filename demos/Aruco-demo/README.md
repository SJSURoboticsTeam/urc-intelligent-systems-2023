# Aruco Tag Detector

## RUN
```bash
python3 run.py
```

Once the program is running, point the camera at an Aruco tag and the tag ID and location will be displayed on the screen.
This tag should be from the 4x4_50 dictionary, which is used by the URC competition.

If you don't have a tag handy, just open up `aruco_0.png` on your computer and point the camera at it.

If you want to use a different camera, change the `camera_id` variable in `run.py`.
